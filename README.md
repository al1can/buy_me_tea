buy me tea
<br>
- Well another project that I started and left because I got bored. I pushed it so maybe later on if I want to work on it I can find it here. Tried to work with tailwind and did some stuff but npm has a problem and doesn't show the last updates that I did and right now don't want to work on why my front end gives a problem. Maybe later on I might add stripe api for transaction maybe not so...
